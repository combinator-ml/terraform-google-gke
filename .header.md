# terraform-google-kubernetes

Combinator infrastructure module that creates a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud Platform, powered by Google Kubernetes Engine.

## Usage

Please note that you need a GCP account and project in order to use this module. The following represents the minimal configuration and creates the cheapest GKE cluster available.

```terraform
module "terraform-google-kubernetes" {
  source  = "combinator-ml/kubernetes/google"
  version = "0.0.0"
  gcp_project_id = "your-gpc-project-id"
}
```

See the full configuration options below.

### Costs

This runs in a single zone, which means it falls under GCP's free management tier and you don't have to pay for management nodes, only worker nodes. After the first zone you pay, and that's when it gets expensive. See the [GCP pricing pages](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/pricing#cluster_management_fee_and_free_tier) for more information.
